# Project01
For project one our group used server side APIs to pull data from Ticketmaster and Google Maps Platform for the user to search for events in their location. With the Ticketmaster API we were able to pull information about certain events such as music, sports and family friendly events. With the ajax we are able to pull information for a specified date. The Google API that we used is the Routes API, which is from the Google Maps Platform. We chose the Routes API because we wanted to add a get direction functionality to our website. We didn't implement this functionality before the project due date.
